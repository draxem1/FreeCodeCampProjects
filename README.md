#About
These are projects I did while learning to program, using [FreeCodeCamp's](https://freecodecamp.com) website.
The website is just as it's name, free! It has four courses, but I only did the **Front-End**. It took me a about two
months to complete. It's very interactive, and I like how after it shows an example of the code, you immediately
have to input code into a terminal. Some of the bon-fire challenges for javascript are very challenging, at least
for beginners, but if you have trouble you can ask around on they're forum. The **Front-End** course had 10 projects
that may not make you an expert but will give you a huge push towards it! I suggest if you haven't checked it out to 
check it out.

##Advice
        - Don't spend alot of time in the forums!
        - Google is your friend & so is Mozilla's javascript referance.
        - Take your time, and don't cheat yourself.
        - Program every day!
        - If you forget use map to go back and look at previous code
        - And last but not least have fun!
