#About
These are projects I did while learning to program, using [FreeCodeCamp's](https://freecodecamp.com) website.
The website is just as it's name, free! It has four courses, but I only did one. It took me a about two
months to complete. It's very interactive, and I like how after it shows an example of the code, you immediately
have to input code into a terminal. Some of the bon-fire challenges for javascript are very challenging, at least
for beginners, but if you have trouble you can ask around on they're forum. The **Front-End** course had 10 projects
that are simple, and yet challenging. I suggest if you haven't checked it out, to do so.
